# welshtime

- Map time and date into Welsh words.
- Uses the traditional number system (vigesimal like French, but with the words the other way around.)
- The modern (Argentine Welsh) system used in schools and with beginners is not implemented (yet.)

See the implementation in [WelshTimeTest.java](/app/src/test/java/net/dafydd/welshtime/WelshTimeTest.java)
